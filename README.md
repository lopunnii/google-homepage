The Odin Project

Google Homepage Project

The Google Homepage Project is my first project using basic HTML and CSS to build the google.com homepage.
 
Self-reflection:

It has been one month since I started learning web development through The Odin Project, and I have now finished the Google homepage project. 
It felt very daunting at first as I had never made anything with HTML and CSS, and wasn't sure how to even start. 
I managed by going through one simple thing at a time like just inserting the google logo image, then making the basic text input form, and then things just started falling into place. I am very estatic that I was able to complete the project.

The parts that I struggled the most with in making this homepage was aligning everything horizontally and vertically. 
Originally, I was finding bits of solutions from different sites and although it was somewhat working, the code became very messy and I didn't understand what I was doing. 
I thought there must be a simpler way, so I tried to then learn CSS Flexbox. Although I could understand the basics of it, I couldn't figure out how to apply it into the google homepage. In the end, I found a very simple solution of just using text-align; center for everything and adding padding just to the google image whihch shifted everything to the center vertically. 
Another part I struggled with was adding the logos through the Google stylesheet into the navigation bar and the search bar. I had to find the solutions for that in The Odin Project Discord server. 

The parts I enjoyed the most was adding the little details such as hover effects. Although it was suggested to ignore these and to not aim for perfection, I really wanted to figure out how to do it as that small interactivity made it feel like a real website and I liked seeing it come to life. 

This google homepage project has helped me put into practice the HTML and CSS skills I have learned and I now feel more confident about the basics. I also feel more comfortable with using git and github. I am looking forward to figuring out the next project in web development. Perhaps I will figure out CSS flexbox in a future project.
